                    I am a dedicated professional with a strong passion for coding and programming. Working through an intensive 3-month coding bootcamp, acquiring comprehensive knowledge and skills in C#, CSS, HTML as well as a basis to further adapt new languages into my arsenal. This immersive educational experience has, so far, equipped me with the ability to develop innovative solutions and create dynamic web applications. My growing proficiency in coding languages, combined with an already honed commitment to continuous learning and growth, may position myself as an asset in any team or organization seeking a versatile and skilled developer.
