                In partnership, we created a Tamagotchi-style game representing a pet shelter called Foxden. Players can add/remove foxes, play with individual or multiple pets, and interact by feeding, playing, bathing, and putting them to sleep. User actions impact the foxes' statuses, emphasizing continuous attention. Our game provides a fun small experience, simulating the responsibility and joy of caring for virtual shelter pets.

                In one of my earliest projects, I developed an engaging number guessing game. The game mechanics involve the player inputting an integer and subsequently determining whether their guess matches the target number. In the event of an accurate guess, the player emerges triumphant, whereas an incorrect guess allows for two additional attempts to reach the correct answer. This simple yet captivating game design serves as a testament to my early forays into creating interactive experiences that offer both challenge and enjoyment.
